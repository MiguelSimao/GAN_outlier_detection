## Description
This is a way of solving the issue of classification of out-of-vocabulary gestures. Very often, these gestures are classified as an existing class and are difficult to remove with a classification threshold. The proposed solution has two components: (1) the use of a generative model (GAN) to augment the data set with new generated samples, (2) the use of noisy labels to decrease the average probability of predictions, thus facilitating threshold tuning.

## Usage
Use the file **dualmyo_gan_generator_train.py** to train the generator and discriminator networks. The networks can then be tested with the scripts on **tests_discriminator.py** and **tests_generator.py**.  The description of the methodology is to be published soon.

The networks are implemented in [Keras](https://github.com/keras-team/keras). Aditional libraries used are: numpy, scikit-learn and tensorflow.
